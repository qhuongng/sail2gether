      <p>Recently (circa October 2025), my friend and I have decided to watch a movie together every weekend. Problem is, we live half a world apart. Sharing the screen over video conferencing apps means that one of us will always suffer from poor video and audio quality, and Teleparty only supports legit sources which we c<b>ARRRRRGHHH</b> üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è So, yeah, I spent a day making this. The app name is definitely not a reference btw.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">It was also a good opportunity to explore some tools I didn't have time to check out before, like Firebase and Cloudflare R2. Frankly, I was also lazy and cheap, so this app is essentially just a React client (no server needed yay).</p>

      <p>I assume that you're asking about the <i>inner workings</i> of this site (that's why it's a NFAQ). Essentially, the video the host uploads will be stored in a Cloudflare R2 bucket and made accessible via a public URL (I wrote a Cloudflare worker to help with that, it was pretty cool). Said URL is then made source of a <b>&lt;video&gt;</b> element. The current timestamp and some event flags will be synced frequently to Firebase from the host's client, and the viewer's client listens to them. Voil√†.</p>

      <p>Well, you can choose to remove a room you host, and everything should be deleted from Firebase and the Cloudflare R2 bucket. And I have no incentive to sell your illeg<b>ARRRRRGHHH</b> üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è media anyway, so don't worry.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">One thing to note is that the list of rooms you host will be stored in your browser's <i>localStorage</i>. So please remove all the rooms before clearing your browsing data, or all the room info and videos will not be deleted. None of your personal information is ever recorded or stored in the servers, though.</p>
